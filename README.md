# AJAX News

## Summary

This program is a challenge complete in my time spent at Dev Bootcamp programming school. In this challenge, I wrote the AJAX code using Javascript and JQuery to target specific elements involved in the AJAX request. AJAX is vital to this programs efficiency because of its targeted reload apposed to full-page reconstruction. Instead of sending the entire page layout in the HTTP request, AJAX allows you to send minimal code from the server. This improves the websites efficiency on the server request portion as well as on the client side by one reloading specific portion of the web page. This one page app allows users to make posts, up vote those posts, and delete post without reloading the entire page.

## Programming Languages
