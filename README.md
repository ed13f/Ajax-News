# AJAX News

## Summary

This program is a challenge complete in my time spent at Dev Bootcamp programming school. In this challenge, I wrote the AJAX code using Javascript and JQuery to only change specific elements involved in the AJAX request. AJAX is a vital too this programs efficiency because of its targeted reloads. Instead of sending the entire pages layout in the http request, AJAX allows you to send minimal code from the server. This improves a websites efficiency on the Http request protion as well as on the client side by one reloading specific portions of the web page. This one page app allows users to make posts, upvote those post, and delete post without reloading the entire page.

## Languages Involved in the Program
-Javascript
-JQuery
-HTML
